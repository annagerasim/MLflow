# MLflow
Benchmarking existing ML methods for automated flow cytometry. 

## Helpful scripts/functions:
To export large studies from RedCap API for training, use Python script from [Red Cap Api.py](https://github.com/annagerasim/MLflow/blob/main/Red_Cap_API_call.py)

To parse through studies/files from OneDrive for training, use Python script from [Parsing Data Folders.py](https://github.com/annagerasim/MLflow/blob/main/parsing_data_folders.py)

Once, you establish your training set database, use the following script to both randomly select the files for testing and automatically pull them from the folders [Select Test Data.py](https://github.com/annagerasim/MLflow/blob/main/Selecting_testing_data.py)

The use of all of these scripts are demonstrated in the following [Jupyter Notebook with helpful scripts](https://github.com/annagerasim/MLflow/blob/main/Extracting%20data%20for%20flow%20cytometry%20inventory.ipynb)
